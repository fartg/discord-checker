# discord-checker
A small userscript designed to check for available "pomelo" discord usernames!

(includes a slick little ratelimit workaround too!)

# Must know
If you have already claimed a "pomelo" (non discrimintaor) discord name, you ***cannot*** use this user script.
You ***must*** have access to an account with the "Urgent: Set a username" warning as any data sent to the /pomelo/ endpoint changes to an "Unauthorized" response
when you set it for the first time.

# How to use
* ctrl+shift+i on a discord application or browser window.
* grab your x-super and authorization headers from the "science" request
* input a wordlist in the empty array of the same name 
* set up a webhook for it to post to!
* put all your values in the "Initiate" function on the very bottom
* press enter......
* ???
* profit!!11!1
